# A Brief Study on Cybercrimes and Practices in Mizoram

# Abstract:
This study aims to analyze the level of awareness of cybersecurity and crimes in Mizoram by focusing on various threats from the internet, Social Networking Sites (SNSs), and other communication or computer-oriented crime, in cyberspace along with their significant awareness. In modern technological years, cybercrime is a hot challenge in all areas and aspects including personal security, national security, and public safety. To prevent from being victimized, everyone needs to be informed about some sort of measures and about cybercrimes. A well-structured questionnaire was prepared for the survey as per the cases history recorded provided by the Mizoram police department. The results of this study are important recommendations and need to be carried out by various circles of the general public and specifically for Mizoram. While crime victims are mostly unaware of stranger behaviour to capture their information details, consequently the public awareness level on cybercrime is below average. This study presents a brief overview of all evolving crime, case studies, and the working approach to combat cybercrime in the Mizoram context.
